    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today was the demo day/pitch event organized by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/iiinno.tw">IIINO Taiwan</a> at the Microsoft Taiwan Headquarters.</p>

<p>These early stage startups just emerged from a program that aims to help bring ideas to fruition a span of 6 weeks. Although the list is not complete, you can see some of the startups on the <a href="http://mobilehero.kktix.cc/events/0719">event&rsquo;s page</a>.</p>

<p>There were some interesting startups. One I remember was Right On because the pitch was clear and concised. Right On is developing an event based application that aims to facilitate meetings at professionals events by providing searchable contacts.</p>

<p>Congrats again to &ldquo;Iron Man Makers Group&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m not very good at translating :p ). The name has the word &ldquo;Iron Man&rdquo; in it because one of the projects they built was an Iron Man suit. Their vision is to utilize their combined skillsets in 3D design, printing, hardware and prototyping to create a platfomr that will help people realize their dreams and bring ideas to actual products. The vision reminds me of <a href="http://www.quirky.com/">Quirky</a> but for technology products.</p>

<p>For detail information on the pitch itself, you can check it out <a href="http://blog.geocube.biz/%E7%99%BE%E4%BA%BApitch-demo-show-%E5%BE%8C%E8%A8%98.html">here</a> (it&rsquo;s in traditional Chinese).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>1.5 hrs</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t get to code too much today as I went to attend a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/taiwan-startup/events/192480802/">meetup event</a> in Taipei, hosted by <a href="http://iiinnolearn.weebly.com/">IIINNO</a>. There were handfull of pitches and one of them was <a href="http://between.us/en/">Between</a>, an app that focuses on sharing and commucation between couples. Between started in Korea and they have just raised $3M for Series A earlier this year. They&rsquo;re already in Japan and now expanding to Taiawn and a friend of mine is on the Taiwan team.</p>

<p>I chatted up with some startup peeps including one of the guys from <a href="http://www.techinasia.com/taiwan-sentri-beasted-kickstarter-campaign-smart-home-internet-of-things-taiwan-startup/">Sentri</a>, a smart home security hardware designed for control and visibility of your home.</p>

<p>My first impression of Taiwan&rsquo;s startups is really positive. It&rsquo;s a tight-knit environment that feels like a family. It&rsquo;s somewhat similar to the startup scene in the Philippines, where people are just open minded to share experiences and help one another.</p>

<p>Cheers to all of those who are pursuing their passions and riding them emotional rollercoasters! =)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I almost forgot how fresh and crisp the air is in San Francisco! After spending 9 months with the team in South East Asia, I can&rsquo;t say I miss the humidity one bit.</p>

<p>Since we&rsquo;re a small team, I&rsquo;m doing various things ranging from business development to cleaning the toilet (no, literally). But one of the things I enjoy the most is contributing to our web application!</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Although my background is in Finance, I&rsquo;ve always had an interest in tech and I was learning some front-end things on my own. When I got the chance to design the responsive email template, I was stoked! Although, the code is nothing worth mentioning, and the design was pieced together from different sources, it was still empowering to see the work going out to our customers in the real world.</p>

<p>I was hooked! Since then, I&rsquo;ve been taking oneline courses on my spare time. My goal is to become a better coder so I can help build cool things. Currently, I&rsquo;m learning the Ruby language, Rails framework, and Javascript. I will document my learning process here so one day I can look back and say to myself, &ldquo;hey, you&rsquo;ve come a long way!&rdquo;</p>
