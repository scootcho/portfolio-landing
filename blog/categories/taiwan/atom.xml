<p>I didn&rsquo;t get to code too much today as I went to attend a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/taiwan-startup/events/192480802/">meetup event</a> in Taipei, hosted by <a href="http://iiinnolearn.weebly.com/">IIINNO</a>. There were handfull of pitches and one of them was <a href="http://between.us/en/">Between</a>, an app that focuses on sharing and commucation between couples. Between started in Korea and they have just raised $3M for Series A earlier this year. They&rsquo;re already in Japan and now expanding to Taiawn and a friend of mine is on the Taiwan team.</p>

<p>I chatted up with some startup peeps including one of the guys from <a href="http://www.techinasia.com/taiwan-sentri-beasted-kickstarter-campaign-smart-home-internet-of-things-taiwan-startup/">Sentri</a>, a smart home security hardware designed for control and visibility of your home.</p>

<p>My first impression of Taiwan&rsquo;s startups is really positive. It&rsquo;s a tight-knit environment that feels like a family. It&rsquo;s somewhat similar to the startup scene in the Philippines, where people are just open minded to share experiences and help one another.</p>

<p>Cheers to all of those who are pursuing their passions and riding them emotional rollercoasters! =)</p>
