    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I dropped by at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/rails-taiwan/">Taipei Rails Meetup</a> today. I want to meet people who are also into Rails because it&rsquo;s always more fun to build things with people and learn from one another.</p>

<p>This was an &lsquo;installfest&rsquo; meetup, to make sure everybody has their machine enviornments setup for the classes in the upcoming weeks. I already had my ubuntu virtualbox setup a while back so I ended up chatting with some peeps.</p>

<p>I found out that one of the mentors here, &lsquo;xdite&rsquo; had actually written a <a href="https://leanpub.com/rails-101">book</a> on Rails, called <a href="https://leanpub.com/rails-101">Rails 101</a>. It&rsquo;s in traditional Chinese so if you can read it, check it out! You can download the <a href="https://leanpub.com/rails-101/packages/book/purchases/new">Rails 101 ebook</a> for <strong>free</strong> on leanpub. All you need to do is set the price to <strong>$0</strong> under the <em>&ldquo;Name Your Price&rdquo;</em> section. Of course, buying and donating to the author is more than welcome!</p>
