    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I dropped by at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/rails-taiwan/">Taipei Rails Meetup</a> today. I want to meet people who are also into Rails because it&rsquo;s always more fun to build things with people and learn from one another.</p>

<p>This was an &lsquo;installfest&rsquo; meetup, to make sure everybody has their machine enviornments setup for the classes in the upcoming weeks. I already had my ubuntu virtualbox setup a while back so I ended up chatting with some peeps.</p>

<p>I found out that one of the mentors here, &lsquo;xdite&rsquo; had actually written a <a href="https://leanpub.com/rails-101">book</a> on Rails, called <a href="https://leanpub.com/rails-101">Rails 101</a>. It&rsquo;s in traditional Chinese so if you can read it, check it out! You can download the <a href="https://leanpub.com/rails-101/packages/book/purchases/new">Rails 101 ebook</a> for <strong>free</strong> on leanpub. All you need to do is set the price to <strong>$0</strong> under the <em>&ldquo;Name Your Price&rdquo;</em> section. Of course, buying and donating to the author is more than welcome!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>1.5 hrs</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t get to code too much today as I went to attend a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/taiwan-startup/events/192480802/">meetup event</a> in Taipei, hosted by <a href="http://iiinnolearn.weebly.com/">IIINNO</a>. There were handfull of pitches and one of them was <a href="http://between.us/en/">Between</a>, an app that focuses on sharing and commucation between couples. Between started in Korea and they have just raised $3M for Series A earlier this year. They&rsquo;re already in Japan and now expanding to Taiawn and a friend of mine is on the Taiwan team.</p>

<p>I chatted up with some startup peeps including one of the guys from <a href="http://www.techinasia.com/taiwan-sentri-beasted-kickstarter-campaign-smart-home-internet-of-things-taiwan-startup/">Sentri</a>, a smart home security hardware designed for control and visibility of your home.</p>

<p>My first impression of Taiwan&rsquo;s startups is really positive. It&rsquo;s a tight-knit environment that feels like a family. It&rsquo;s somewhat similar to the startup scene in the Philippines, where people are just open minded to share experiences and help one another.</p>

<p>Cheers to all of those who are pursuing their passions and riding them emotional rollercoasters! =)</p>
