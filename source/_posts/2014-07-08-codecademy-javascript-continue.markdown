3.5 hrs

I continued the Codecademy's [JavaScript Track][track] today. My goal is to wrap up this week so I can build more front-end mini projects.

Although I did a couple of basic JavaScript projects earlier ([Sketchpad][pad] & [Project Euler][euler]), but I felt the need for more practice with my JavaScript & jQuery when I was working on the [range slider][slider] last week.

Good thing is, I have already scoped out a couple of cool mini projects to build:

{% codepen IHbvh jackrugile result 440 %}

<!--more-->

{% codepen sjcoa zerospree result 440 %}

I'm looking forward to make some cool stuff. If you happen to see anything cool to build, please let me know! Thanks!
