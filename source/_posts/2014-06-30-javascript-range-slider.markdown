I thought it's also important to sharpen some of my front-end skills as well so I chose the [HTML5 Range Slider][slider]for practice.


{% codepen nKHfy scootcho result 440 %}

I'm sure you've noticed the slider nob is a little messed up. I even went back and copied and pasted the code from the source but it didn't help. I think this might be a browser thing. As quoted in the [walkthrough][slider]:

{% blockquote %}
Note: This is a chrome only demo/walkthrough as it uses features which are currently not supported in other browsers.
{% endblockquote %}

If you have any idea how to fix this issue please let me know! I'd love to know!
