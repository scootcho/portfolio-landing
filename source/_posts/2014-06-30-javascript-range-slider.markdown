I thought it's also important to sharpen some of my front-end skills as well so I chose the <a href="http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/spicing-up-the-html5-range-slider-input?utm_source=TheCodePlayer&utm_campaign=5b4d9871a4-Direct_Messages10_1_2013&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_9d9ac48e00-5b4d9871a4-89594157" target="_blank">HTML5 Range Slider</a> for practice.

I'm sure you've noticed the slider nob is a little messed up. I even went back and copied and pasted the code from the source but it didn't help. I think this might be a browser thing. As quoted in the <a href="http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/spicing-up-the-html5-range-slider-input?utm_source=TheCodePlayer&utm_campaign=5b4d9871a4-Direct_Messages10_1_2013&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_9d9ac48e00-5b4d9871a4-89594157" target="_blank">walkthrough</a> :

{% blockquote %}
Note: This is a chrome only demo/walkthrough as it uses features which are currently not supported in other browsers.
{% endblockquote %}
