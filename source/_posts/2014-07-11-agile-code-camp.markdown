2 hrs

While at the [Taiwan startup meetup][event] a couple of days ago, I expressed my interests in learning coding and checking out some local groups. One awesome guy told me about [Agile Code Camp][codecamp], a free JavaScript development course that practice Agile Development and uses Meteor as web development framework.


I will update once I check out the program! Cheers!
