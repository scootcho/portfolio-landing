I almost forgot how fresh and crisp the air is in San Francisco! After 9 months in South East Asia, I can't say I miss the humidity one bit.

While working at the startup, I've done various things from business development to mopping the floor since we have a small team. But one of the things I enjoyed the most was the chance to contribute to our web application.

Although my background is in Finance, I've always had an interest in design and I was learning some graphic design on my own. When I got the chance to design the responsive email template, I was stoked! Although, the code is nothing worth mentioning, and the design was pieced together from different sources, it was still empowering to see the work going out to our customers in the real world.

I was hooked! Since then, I've been taking oneline courses on my spare time. My goal is to become better so I can help build cool things. Currently, I'm learning the Ruby language and the Rails framework. I will document my learning process here so one day I can look back and say to myself, "hey, you've come a long way!"
