I dropped by at the [Taipei Rails Meetup][railstw] today. I want to meet people who are also into Rails because it's always more fun to build things with people and learn from one another.



This was an 'installfest' meetup, to make sure everybody has their machine enviornments setup for the classes in the upcoming weeks. I already had my ubuntu virtualbox setup a while back so I ended up chatting with some peeps.

I found out that one of the mentors here, 'xdite' had actually written a [book][rails101] on Rails, called [Rails 101][rails101]. It's in traditional Chinese so if you can read it, check it out! You can download the [Rails 101 ebook][buybook] for **free** on leanpub. All you need to do is set the price to **$0** under the *"Name Your Price"* section. Of course, buying and donating to the author is more than welcome!
