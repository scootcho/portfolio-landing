1.5 hrs

I didn't get to code too much today as I went to attend a [meetup event][event] in Taipei, hosted by [IIINNO][iiinno]. There were handfull of pitches and one of them was [Between][between], an app that focuses on sharing and commucation between couples. Between started in Korea and they have just raised $3M for Series A earlier this year. They're already in Japan and now expanding to Taiawn and a friend of mine is on the Taiwan team.

I chatted up with some startup peeps including one of the guys from [Sentri][sentri], a smart home security hardware designed for control and visibility of your home.

My first impression of Taiwan's startups is really positive. It's a tight-knit environment that feels like a family. It's somewhat similar to the startup scene in the Philippines, where people are just open minded to share experiences and help one another.

Cheers to all of those who are pursuing their passions and riding them emotional rollercoasters! =)
