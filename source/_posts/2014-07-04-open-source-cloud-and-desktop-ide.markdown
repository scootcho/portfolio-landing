I came across [Codebox IDE][codebox] an open source cloud IDE because a project I'm working on is using it as the cloud development enviornment.

excerpt from site:

> Codebox is built with web technologies: `node.js`, `javascript`, `html` and `less`. The IDE possesses a very modular and extensible architecture, that allows you to build your own features with through add-ons. Codebox is the first open and modular IDE capable of running both on the Desktop and in the cloud (with offline support).

This looks like a really interesting project. I hope I will be able to contribute to it in the near future.
