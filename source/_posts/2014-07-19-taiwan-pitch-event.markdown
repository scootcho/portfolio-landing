Today was the demo day/pitch event organized by [IIINO Taiwan][iiino] at the Microsoft Taiwan Headquarters.

These early stage startups just emerged from a program that aims to help bring ideas to fruition a span of 6 weeks. Although the list is not complete, you can see some of the startups on the [event's page][event].

There were some interesting startups. One I remember was Right On because the pitch was clear and concised. Right On is developing an event based application that aims to facilitate meetings at professionals events by providing searchable contacts.

Congrats again to "Iron Man Makers Group" (I'm not very good at translating :p ). The name has the word "Iron Man" in it because one of the projects they built was an Iron Man suit. Their vision is to utilize their combined skillsets in 3D design, printing, hardware and prototyping to create a platfomr that will help people realize their dreams and bring ideas to actual products. The vision reminds me of [Quirky][quirky] but for technology products.


For detail information on the pitch itself, you can check it out [here][geocube] (it's in traditional Chinese).
