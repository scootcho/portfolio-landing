4.5 hrs

I'm almost done with the [JavaScript Track][track] (@86%), and I'm planning to wrap that up with 1-2 more hrs. I feel my foundation is getting a better. This should get me a littler further for more JavaScript codes but I'm planning to read a book to emphasize on foundations. After all, to be able to understand and use a language, a solid foundation will make one more fluent. Since I think I will be using JavaScript long time down the road, it should be a great investment of my time.

I was debating on either reading [JavaScript: The Good Parts - Douglas Crockford][goodparts] or [JavaScript: The Definitive Guide - David Flanagan][defguide]. The latter covers JavaScript in great detail and a great reference guide, but being a litte over 1000 pages long. After reading a [comparision][comp], and knowing the pros and cons of the two, I've decided to read the [The Good Parts][goodparts] first to give a jump start and I'll cover BIG BOOK later.

If you have any good reading recommendations, please let me know! Thanks!
