Tomorrow, I will be starting the 10 week programming curriculumn at [MakeItWithCode][miwc]. I will document my learning process here to help myself clarify and understand some concepts. Oh yea, and for memorization too because I have a terrible, terrible memory.

Here is the sneak peak of the <strong>course syllabus</strong>, which obtained from the site once you provide your email address.

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Course syllabus</h2>

<strong>Lesson 1: Twitter API</strong>
<p>This is all about getting you used to your development environment and working with other people's code. By the end, you'll be using Ruby to search Twitter and display results the Terminal.</p>


<strong>Lesson 2: CSV & Email</strong>
Data is of limited use when it's stuck within the Terminal. In this lesson, you'll create a simple tool to email yourself an attachment containing the data from your Twitter search.


<strong>Lesson 3: Simple Web App</strong>
<p>Building web apps is the reason many people start learning to code. To start with the basics, you'll build a static web app with 3 pages using Twitter Bootstrap to add a professional layout.</p>


<strong>Lesson 4: Dynamic Web App</strong>
<p>Expanding on the previous lesson, this project makes your web app a bit more interactive. You'll end up with a web app that searches Twitter for tweets about dogs and display them live.</p>


<strong>Lesson 5: Web Scraper</strong>
<p>APIs are awesome for slicing and dicing data from websites, but in practice many sites don't offer one. So to extract the data from Reddit, you're going to construct a simple little web scraper.</p>


<strong>Lesson 6: ToDo List</strong>
<p>This is your first introduction to databases. Building on your basic web app, you'll build a ToDo list that you can add items to from the Terminal and view live in your web app.</p>


<strong>Lesson 7: Useful ToDo List</strong>
<p>Working from the ToDo List, you'll learn a bit more about databases so you can update your list and remove items. You'll be able to mark ToDo items as completed from within the web app.</p>


<strong>Lesson 8: Dashboard</strong>
<p>By this point you'll have realised that using other people's code makes work much easier. This lesson is the best example of that, as you'll end up with an awesome dashboard.</p>


<strong>Lesson 9: Dashboard Deployed!</strong>
<p>You've got a bunch of cool things to show off, now you need to get them online! You're going to tweak the dashboard with a custom widget, upload it to Github and deploy it to Heroku.</p>


<strong>Lesson 10: Complete Website</strong>
<p>One of the most valuable things about knowing how to code is the freedom to throw up simple websites with little time and no money. Whether for a personal portfolio or a client. In this final lesson, you're going to take a Bootstrap template, convert it into a Sinatra application and deploy a real, working website.</p>
